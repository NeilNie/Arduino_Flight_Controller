#Arduino Quadcopter Flight Controller

##Introduction
If you want to build your own quadcopter and are looking for a flight controller, this is it. The project is based on Arduino and written in C. It will support Arduino Uno and Pro Mini directly. Some modifications might be needed for other hardwares. 

##Features

##Setup
First, download/clone/fork the project. In order to run the program, you need some Arduino client installed. In my case, I am using the Arduino client from Arduino.cc. 

##Trouble-shooting

##Credit
I would like to thank specifically Joop Brokking at http://www.brokking.net. He is a very talented engineer from Netherlands who have developed the YMFC project. Joopâ€™s tutorials helped me to better understand quadcopter and taught me a lot of Arduino and micro-controllers. I would strongly recommend his website and his youtube channel.
